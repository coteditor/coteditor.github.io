<h1>Highlights on CotEditor 3.9</h1>

<dl>
	<dt>Invisible characters with more accuracy</dt>
	<dd>The drawing method for invisible characters has been revamped so that the symbols are displayed in accurate and natural positions under a variety of environments, such as proportional fonts, right-to-left writing direction, and vertical text orientation. In addition, more information about invisibles, such as the width of the tab characters and whether the space is kind of no-breaking spaces, can now be known at a glance.</dd>
	
	<dt>Ok, this indentation scope ends here.</dt>
	<dd>It is now possible to draw indentation guide lines. To make it enable, turn on the “Show indent guides” option in the Appearance pane. You can then grasp the scope and level of each indentation easier.</dd>
	
	<dt>Faster, faster!</dt>
	<dd>Since the latter updates of CotEditor 3.8.x series including this CotEditor 3.9.0, CotEditor made a bunch of performance optimizations in various areas.</dd>

<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Fix an issue where the application crashed when a hanging indent depth becomes larger than the editor area.</li>
	<li>Fix an issue where the application hung up by extending the selection with shortcut <kbd>⌥⇧→</kbd> when the character to select is a national flag emoji.</li>
	<li>Fix an issue where the item “Automatic” (ex. Auto-Detect) was missing in the encoding selections in the open panel.</li>
	<li>Fix an issue with multiple cursors where extra characters were deleted when performing forward delete with selection.</li>
	<li>Fix an issue with multiple cursors where just a single UTF-16 character was deleted instead of the whole character when the character to delete consists of multiple UTF-16 characters.</li>
	<li>Fix an issue where the outline menu could select the wrong item while typing.</li>
	<li>Fix an issue where the line numbers could be shifted when printing vertical text orientation documents.</li>
	<li>Fix an issue where line endings could remain when deleting duplicate lines with multiple selections.</li>
	<li>Fix an issue in the character inspector where the inspector was not shown when the target character is hidden due to scroll.</li>
	<li>Fix an issue in the line number view where the line number of the current line was not bolded under a specific condition.</li>
	<li>Fix an issue in scripting with AppleScript/JXA where the application crashed by performing <code>string in ...</code> command.</li>
	<li>Fix an issue in scripting with AppleScript/JXA where the contents of a document can rarely be overwritten with the contents of another document window under very specific conditions.</li>
	<li>Fix an issue with scripting with AppleScript/JXA where the <code>line range</code> command selected a wrong range when the line endings of the document are CRLF.</li>
