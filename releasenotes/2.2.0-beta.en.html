<h1>Highlights on CotEditor 2.2</h1>

<dl>
	<dt>(will be) Available in the Mac App Store</dt>
	<dd>CotEditor 2.2 is planned to be released on the Mac App Store. The system-integrated version management will make easier keeping your CotEditor up to date. You can also continuously get a non-AppStore version to manage it with Cask or something.</dd>
	  
	<dt>Sandboxing</dt>
	<dd>As the App Sandbox guarantees the prohibition of malicious behaviors at the system level, CotEditor became a more reliable OS X application than ever before. The non-AppStore version is also sandboxed.</dd>
	
	<dt>Improvements for the vertical text orientation</dt>
	<dd>Printing document in vertical orientation, displaying line number also on the vertical text mode, or even saving the text orientation state in the document file. Now you can more comfortably edit your text in the vertical orientation.</dd>
	
	<dt>Faster syntax highlighting</dt>
	<dd>The syntax highlighting becomes further faster and more nicely.</dd>
	
	<dt>Print feature improvement</dt>
	<dd>Other than the vertical text print, the print feature has been improved, for instance, to change page settings in the print panel, to store CotEditor's own print settings to the system print preset.</dd>
	
	<dt>El Capitan support</dt>
	<dd>CotEditor 2.2.0 works well on OS X El Capitan.</dd>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
	<li>CotEditor is now <strong>Sandboxed</strong>.</li>
	<li>New setting option for the behavior on document modification by external process (in General pane).</li>
	<li>Share button in toolbar (Customize toolbar to use it).</li>
	<li>Save text orientation state to the file and restore it when the file is opened.
	<ul>
		<li><strong>for advanced users</strong>: In this feature, CotEditor saves an <em>extended attribute</em> which named <code>com.coteditor.VerticalText</code> to the file only when the editor's text orientation is vertical. You can even disable the feature running the command <code>defaults write com.coteditor.CotEditor savesTextOrientation -bool NO</code> in Terminal. </li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Line number view for vertical text orientation.</li>
	<li>Print with vertical text orientation.</li>
	<li>Add interpreter name list to the syntax style definition to determine syntax style from the shebang in the file content for in case when syntax style cannot be determined from the file name.
	<ul>
		<li>From this change, some of the bundled syntax styles are also updated.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Add <code>encoding:</code> and <code>coding:</code> to the encoding declaration keywords which will be used on encoding auto-detection (interpreting priorities are: <code>charset=</code> &gt; <code>encoding=</code> &gt; <code>@charset</code> &gt; <code>encoding:</code> &gt; <code>coding:</code>).</li>
</ul>

<section>
<h2>Additions/Changes</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>Since the Sparkle framework which is a software update framework we use doesn't support Sandboxed apps yet, the auto-update feature within CotEditor should be once disabled. The new behavior is: a nofitication window will be shown when a new release is available (as before), then you need to update CotEditor manually getting the new version from our web-site. Or, just migrate to the Mac App Store version when the stable CotEditor 2.2.0 is released.</li>

	<li>Move scripts folder location from <code>~/Library/Application Support/CotEditor/ScriptMenu/</code> to <code>~/Library/Application Scripts/com.coteditor.CotEditor/</code> due of the Sandbox requirement.
	<ul>

	</ul></li>
	<li>Improve print document:
	<ul>
		<li>Update header/footer layout to conform to the standard system header/footer design.</li>

		<li>To restore also the last syntax style mode of unsaved documents.</li>
