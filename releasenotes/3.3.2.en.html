<h1>Highlights on CotEditor 3.3</h1>

<dl>
	<dt>Handle documents on launch in more intelligent way</dt>
	<dd>We improved various behaviors regarding document handling on launch for letting you start working with your documents more and more right away.</dd>
	
	<dt>Sort lines as you desire</dt>
	<dd>New “Sort by pattern” enables you to sort selected lines by specific column or fully freely using the regular expression. Of course, through a neat user interface.</dd>
	
	<dt>iCloud document (finally)</dt>
	<dd>We know it's kind of too late, but CotEditor now supports the iCloud document, so that CotEditor has a own space on iCloud, moves files to there easier, and can resolve a file modification conflict visually.</dd>
	
	<dt>Improvement on the Share featue</dt>
	<dd>Document sharing in CotEditor gets more feature.</dd>
	
	<dt>More macOS native look &amp; feel</dt>
	<dd>Added small tweaks to the user interface. You don't see any different? Then, that's good. It means it worked.</dd>
	
	<dt>More international</dt>
	<dd>CotEditor now supports the RTL (right-to-left) writing direction for such as Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi and others. Furthermore, Portuguese localization is newly added.</dd>
